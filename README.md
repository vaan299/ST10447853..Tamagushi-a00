Shivaan Soobrayan (Imad assessment 2)
The purpose of this application:The purpose of this app was to create something simmilar to theTamakoshi app.So we basically put a small figure and made it act as the Tamakosh.I have the home screen which consists of the image of the figure and the start button to begin the process and take you to the main UI interphase which includes (3 buttons,play,clean and feed)
The app is basically like having a small pet in your mobile phone that was the main purpose of creating the app.
The app has 2 interpases the home screen with a big welcome sign and the user interpases which has the controls for the Tamakoshi.
It also has the pages of code 1 for the welcome screen and 1 for the interphase

The utilisation of GitHub it basically made submitting a code much easierand its very user friendly once you get the hang of it.
The Github actions were also very useful
